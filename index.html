        	<p> 	Gallup world poll surveyed people from 146 countries in order to determine an overall happiness score that is based on health, social support, and economic factors. Northern European countries like Finland and Denmark scored highest. According to their website, the Gallup corporation says through their annual, representative surveys, they reach 99 percent of the adult population across the globe. Their goal is to provide global leaders with the facts and to share people’s voices in order to create real change. In world happiness data polls, Gallup aimed to use untraditional metrics in order to genuinely measure people’s happiness. Instead of geering the survey towards individual occupation, income, and unemployment, these surveys measure the following categories: GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. These categories highlight trending emotions across a nation. The data focuses on the internal perception rather than external. One of the chief editors of the World Happiness Report, John F. Helliwell, is featured on the Gallup website saying the quality of a society can determine a person’s level of happiness. </p>

        	<p>       By researching behavior and comparing well-being alongside economic and social prosperity, Gallup can display citizen’s day to day emotions as well as an entire country's overall satisfaction. The Gallup happiness world poll breaks down a series of questions in order to uncover the truth about a community. First the Gallup reporter asks the individual to rate their life on a scale ranging from the best possible life to worst possible life out of 10. The individual must also rate where they expect to be on this scale in five years. Based on the individual’s response, they are marked under “suffering” which is numerically 0-4, struggling, being 5-7, and thriving which is 8-10. The questions that follow deal with emotional well being. The people being surveyed are asked questions revolving around positive and negative experiences. Most surveys are conducted face to face or over the phone. Surveys in previous years have fluctuated depending on how tense of a political climate it is that particular year.

<h2> 
	Northern European Countries Score Highest </h2>

	<div class=paragraph3> 
	<p> Northern European countries are typically viewed as having a higher happiness rate by other regions, and there are several possibilities that may impact the results. Dr. Meredith Martin, a psychology professor at Syracuse University, has a background in behavioral psychology. Through the lens of psychology, people can better understand a data report on happiness. 
“It comes down to people's internal experiences both their thoughts and emotions. The ways in which we interpret the world can impact how we feel even at the biological and physiological level. The way in which we feel at those levels can impact how we interpret what’s happening and how we interpret the world around us. Both those things impact behavior and are impacted by behavior,” Dr. Martin said  

Dr. Martin proposed a few theories on why individual’s feel happier in northern European countries. The first argument deals with the psychological study of intrinsic motivation. “Because of the way the school system is set up, it encourages individuals to pursue occupations that are intrinsically rewarding. There’s less pressure to adopt a particular occupation solely for money,” Dr. Martin said. Although she said there needs to be more research on that argument to determine if it’s correct, Dr. Martin said that with the self-determination theory and what studies show in terms of intrinsic motivation, that approach makes logical sense. “The self-reported part is important because it’s people's perceptions of happiness,” Dr. Martin said.
Further, Dr. Martin explained the psychological idea of in group and out group work which also explains why people feel generally happier. “People who live in northern countries tend to be very similar to each other, racially, historically, socioeconomically similar, comparatively to a lot of other countries…It would make sense to me that when you feel absolutely comfortable everywhere you go in your country, that you never interact with people who have a different experience than you, or a different world view than you, it probably feels good, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s actually better,” Dr. Martin said.

	<div class=paragraph> 
	<p> The second most recent world happiness survey occurred in 2019. Compared to the 2022 world happiness survey, both reports are extremely similar. They display almost exactly the same 20 highest scoring countries. Finland and Denmark again hold the top two spots. France however is not included in the top 20 in the 2019 data set, and Costa Rica takes a spot instead. Dr. Martin is interested in the differences between the highest scoring countries and the lowest ones. “I think the data is interesting to stimulate investigation into what are the types of factors that might be contributing to differences if we want to help everyone live a happy fulfilled life,” Dr. Martin said. Positive psychology is another branch of psychology that applies to this data. “I think the goal of positive psychology is to help all people whether you're talking about the societal level or the individual level. The perspective that I come at from my training and research is focused on how people maintain a feeling of safety in an unsafe situation,” Dr. Martin said. The psychology behind feeling safe and secure in a community is Dr. Martin’s specialty. She referred to Abraham Mazlow’s hierarchy of needs to explain that people who feel generally safe can then focus on life beyond foundational necessities. Dr. Martin assumes that there are some “broad aspects of life in Northern European countries that I would not be surprised would influence people’s perceived self-reported happiness…There’s an expectation that everyone is going to have some basic level of care, so that doesn’t surprise me that it would relieve some of the stressors that relieve a sense of happiness,” Dr. Martin said.
